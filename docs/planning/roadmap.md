## 📈 Version 2.0 - Health & Wellness Expansion

**Goal**: Add optional health tracking for users who want more comprehensive logging.

### Health Tracking Modules
- **Diet Tracking**: 
  - Light mode (default): Overall eating satisfaction 1-5 scale (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent) + optional notes (text field for additional details about eating patterns)
  - Standard mode (advanced): Calories (integer input, unit: kcal), Protein/Carbs/Fat (one decimal place, unit: g)
  - Users can switch between modes at any time in settings
- **Exercise Tracking**: 
  - Initial question: "Did you work out?" (Yes/No toggle)
  - If No: Physical Activity Level 1-5 scale (1=sedentary, 5=very active), skip structured workout fields
  - If Yes: Exercise Type dropdown with presets (Cardio/Strength Training) plus custom text input option, Duration (integer minutes), Subjective Feeling 1-5 scale (1 = terrible, 5 = excellent)
- **Sleep Tracking**: Sleep Duration (one decimal place, unit: hours), Sleep Quality 1-5 scale (user self-assessment), Notes (optional text field)
- **Productivity Module**: Focus Time (integer minutes - total deep work time for the day), Focus Quality 1-5 scale (quality assessment of focus sessions)

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Module Settings**: Enable/disable entire health sections (when disabled, forms hide immediately from current day's entry, but historical data preserved)
- **Sub-module Toggles**: Individual components can be toggled on/off within each module
- **Quick Fill Features**: "Copy from Yesterday" function (quickly copies previous day's quantitative data), common values can be set as defaults
- **Advanced Validation**: All numeric fields show acceptable ranges, out-of-range or incorrect format triggers red border highlight, range validation for health metrics
- **Collapsed Sections**: Page loads with sections collapsed by default, only enabled modules auto-expand, all other sections remain collapsed to reduce scrolling

**Timeline**: Post-MVP 1.0 completion, user feedback dependent
