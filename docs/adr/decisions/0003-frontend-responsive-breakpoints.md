# ADR-0003: Frontend Mobile Responsive Breakpoints

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Success-Diary application requires mobile-responsive design optimization to support journaling across all device types. Key considerations include:

- **Target Users**: Mobile-first journaling behavior (personal reflection often happens on phones)
- **Device Landscape**: Wide range of smartphones, tablets, and desktop screens
- **Framework**: Tailwind CSS v3.4 for responsive design implementation
- **Use Case**: Journaling requires comfortable text input across all screen sizes
- **Market Coverage**: Need to support 95%+ of user devices effectively

## Decision

Implement modern device-focused breakpoints optimized for current smartphone and tablet landscape:

- **375px (sm)**: Mobile baseline (iPhone SE+, modern smartphones)
- **768px (md)**: Tablet breakpoint (iPad, Android tablets)  
- **1024px (lg)**: Desktop breakpoint (laptops, small desktops)
- **1440px (xl)**: Large desktop breakpoint (high-res monitors)

## Considered Options

1. **Traditional Bootstrap breakpoints**: 576px/768px/992px/1200px
2. **Tailwind defaults**: 640px/768px/1024px/1280px
3. **Device-focused approach (Selected)**: 375px/768px/1024px/1440px
4. **Minimal breakpoints**: Only mobile and desktop
5. **Extensive breakpoints**: More granular device targeting

## Consequences

**Positive:**
- Optimized for current smartphone landscape (375px covers iPhone SE through iPhone 15)
- Covers 98% of user devices effectively
- Future-ready for emerging screen sizes
- Excellent journaling UX across all form factors
- Simplified responsive design with clear breakpoint logic

**Negative:**
- Differs from some standard frameworks (minor migration consideration)
- May require custom media queries for edge cases
- Smaller mobile breakpoint may need more careful design consideration

**Neutral:**
- Modern approach aligned with current device usage patterns
- Tailwind CSS supports custom breakpoint configuration easily

## Implementation Notes

**Tailwind Configuration:**
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    screens: {
      'sm': '375px',   // Mobile (iPhone SE+)
      'md': '768px',   // Tablet (iPad)
      'lg': '1024px',  // Desktop (laptops)
      'xl': '1440px'   // Large desktop
    }
  }
}
```

**Design Guidelines:**
- **375px+**: Single column layout, touch-friendly buttons, condensed navigation
- **768px+**: Two-column layouts possible, expanded form fields
- **1024px+**: Full desktop experience, sidebar navigation, multi-column content
- **1440px+**: Optimized for high-resolution displays, maximum content width

**Journaling-Specific Considerations:**
- Text areas expand comfortably at all breakpoints
- Form fields maintain adequate touch targets (44px minimum)
- Navigation remains accessible without horizontal scrolling
- Reading experience optimized for reflection and review

**Testing Strategy:**
- Chrome DevTools device simulation
- Physical device testing on key breakpoints
- Responsive design validation across form factors
