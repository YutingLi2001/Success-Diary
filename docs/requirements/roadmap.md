- **Automatic Timestamps**: System automatically records submission timestamp for every entry saved
- **Emotion Point Limits**: Enforce exact item count constraints:
  - **Highlights**: 1-3 items (minimum 1 required) - brief sentences about daily achievements
  - **Gratitude**: 1-3 items (minimum 1 required) - brief sentences about things to be grateful for  
  - **Anxiety**: 0-3 items (optional, can be empty) - brief sentences about worries or concerns
- **Free-form Journal Limits**: Suggested 4,000-character soft limit for journal text field

#### Entry Management
- **Edit Historical Entries**: Full editing capability for past entries with overwrite behavior
- **Entry Deletion**: Hard delete with confirmation warning for user safety
- **Entry Validation**: Enhanced form validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Auto-save**: Draft saving to prevent data loss

#### Essential User Experience
- **Saving Feedback**: Gentle confirmation messages after successful saves
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimized interface for mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with recovery guidance
- **Required Rating**: Users must provide 1-5 integer rating or "-" to save entry (this field is ALWAYS enabled and cannot be disabled)

**Estimated Completion**: 8-10 development hours

### MVP 1.0 Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)

- ⏳ **Today's Entry in History**: Today's entry appears in History view immediately after saving
- ⏳ Entry editing capability for historical entries
- ⏳ Entry titles with auto-generated fallback: When users don't provide a custom title, the system automatically generates one using the date
- ⏳ Dynamic UI with progressive field display
- ⏳ Enhanced form validation and error handling
- ⏳ Mobile-responsive design optimization

#### Should Have (Enhanced Experience - Future)
- **Onboarding Flow**: Guides new users through initial setup and first entry
- **Advanced Validation**: Real-time validation feedback and input assistance
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced caching and load time improvements

#### Could Have (Nice to Have - Future)

## 📈 Version 2.0 - Health & Wellness Expansion

**Goal**: Add optional health tracking for users who want more comprehensive logging.

### Health Tracking Modules
- **Diet Tracking**: 
  - Light mode (default): Overall eating satisfaction 1-5 scale + optional notes
  - Standard mode (advanced): Calories (kcal), Protein/Carbs/Fat (grams with 1 decimal place)
  - Users can switch between modes anytime in settings
- **Exercise Tracking**: 
  - Initial toggle: "Did you work out?" (Yes/No)
  - If No: Physical Activity Level 1-5 scale (1=sedentary, 5=very active)
  - If Yes: Exercise Type dropdown (Cardio/Strength Training/custom), Duration (minutes), Subjective Feeling 1-5 scale
- **Sleep Tracking**: Duration (hours with 1 decimal), Quality 1-5 scale, optional notes
- **Productivity Module**: Focus Time (integer minutes), Focus Quality 1-5 scale

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Module Settings**: Enable/disable entire health sections (when disabled, forms hide immediately from current day's entry, but historical data preserved)
- **Sub-module Toggles**: Individual components can be toggled on/off within each module
- **Quick Fill Features**: "Copy from Yesterday" functionality for quantitative data, common values can be set as defaults
- **Advanced Validation**: Range validation for health metrics with red border highlights for out-of-range values
- **Collapsed Sections**: Page loads with sections collapsed by default, only enabled modules auto-expand

**Timeline**: Post-MVP 1.0 completion, user feedback dependent

  - Sub-items within groups: Numeric (with units & min/max limits), Short text, 1-5 star rating
  - Fields ordered by creation time, adjustable by drag-and-drop in settings
  - All field management happens in separate settings page, not daily entry interface
- **Data Persistence**: Adding/removing fields takes effect immediately, historical data never lost when fields removed
- **Advanced Analytics**: Trend charts, pattern recognition, data visualization
- **Data Export**: JSON/CSV export functionality with date range selection
- **Data Import**: Backup restoration and data migration tools

### Integration & Enhancement Features
