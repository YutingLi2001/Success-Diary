## üéØ Version 1.0 MVP - Core Features (Current Phase)

**Goal**: Prove core concept of daily emotional reflection and establish user habits.

### Remaining MVP Features

#### Daily Journal Entry System Enhancement
- **Entry Titles**: Custom titles (30 char limit) with auto-generated date fallback (example: "January 15, 2025")
- **Dynamic UI**: Progressive field display (show next line only after current has content - minimizes scrolling)
- **Entry Rules**: Enforce one entry per calendar day (user timezone-based)
- **Automatic Timestamps**: System automatically records submission timestamp for every entry saved
- **Three Emotion Points** (**This is the key differentiator and main value proposition**): Enforce exact item count constraints:
  - **Highlights**: 1-3 items (minimum 1 required) - brief sentences about daily achievements
  - **Gratitude**: 1-3 items (minimum 1 required) - brief sentences about things to be grateful for  
  - **Anxiety**: 0-3 items (optional, can be empty) - brief sentences about worries or concerns
  - Maximum 3 items per category, no more allowed
  - UI behavior: Show only one input line initially, display next line only after current line has content (minimize scrolling)
- **Daily Free-form Journal**: One text field for free writing about the day, completely optional (users can leave blank with no minimum character requirement), suggested 4,000-character soft limit
- **Date-based System**: Entries are organized by calendar date

#### Entry Management
- **Edit Historical Entries**: Full editing capability for past entries with overwrite behavior
- **Entry Deletion**: Hard delete with confirmation warning for user safety
- **Entry Validation**: Enhanced form validation with user-friendly error messages, frontend validation before backend submission
- **Auto-save**: Draft saving to prevent data loss

#### Essential User Experience
- **Saving Feedback**: Display gentle confirmation "Today's journal has been saved" after saving
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimized interface for mobile devices
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with recovery guidance
- **Overall Daily Rating**: Located at the very end of each journal entry, users must provide 1-5 integer rating or "-" to save entry (this field is ALWAYS enabled and cannot be disabled), will be used for future trend charts/visualizations

**Estimated Completion**: 8-10 development hours

### MVP 1.0 Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)

## üìà Version 2.0 - Health & Wellness Expansion

**Goal**: Add optional health tracking for users who want more comprehensive logging.

### Health Tracking Modules
- **Diet Tracking**: 
  - Light mode (default): Overall eating satisfaction 1-5 scale (1 = very poor, 5 = excellent) + optional notes (text field for additional details about eating patterns)
  - Standard mode (advanced): Calories (integer input, unit: kcal), Protein/Carbs/Fat (one decimal place, unit: g)
  - Users can switch between modes at any time in settings
- **Exercise Tracking**: 
  - Initial question: "Did you work out?" (Yes/No toggle)
  - If No: Physical Activity Level 1-5 scale (1=sedentary, 5=very active), skip structured workout fields
  - If Yes: Exercise Type dropdown with presets (Cardio/Strength Training) plus custom text input option, Duration (integer minutes), Subjective Feeling 1-5 scale (1 = terrible, 5 = excellent)
- **Sleep Tracking**: Sleep Duration (one decimal place, unit: hours), Sleep Quality 1-5 scale (user self-assessment), Notes (optional text field)
- **Productivity Module**: Focus Time (integer minutes - total deep work time for the day), Focus Quality 1-5 scale (quality assessment of focus sessions)

### Enhanced User Experience
- **Module Settings**: Enable/disable entire health sections (when disabled, forms hide immediately from current day's entry, but historical data preserved)
- **Sub-module Toggles**: Individual components can be toggled on/off within each module
- **Quick Fill Features**: "Copy from Yesterday" function (quickly copies previous day's quantitative data), common values can be set as defaults
- **Advanced Validation**: All numeric fields show acceptable ranges, out-of-range or incorrect format triggers red border highlight, range validation for health metrics
- **Collapsed Sections**: Page loads with sections collapsed by default, only enabled modules auto-expand, all other sections remain collapsed to reduce scrolling

**Timeline**: Post-MVP 1.0 completion, user feedback dependent
