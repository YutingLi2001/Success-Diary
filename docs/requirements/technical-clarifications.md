# Technical Clarifications & Planning Questions

## üö® Critical - Must Answer Before Coding

### **Database Session Management Architecture**
**Impact**: High - Foundation for all data operations
- How exactly will we handle async (FastAPI-Users) vs sync (SQLModel Entry operations) session coordination?
- Will we use dependency injection for session handling? 
- How do we manage transaction boundaries between auth and business logic?
- Should we standardize on async-only or create clear separation patterns?

### **Entry Model Business Logic**
**Impact**: High - Core feature correctness
- **One Entry Per Day Rule**: Database constraint, application logic, or both?
- **Time Zone Handling**: User's local time vs server time for "daily" entries?
- **Entry Editing Constraints**: Can users edit any historical date? Time limits? Audit trail?

### **MVP Scope & Timeline Realism**
**Impact**: High - Project success
- Are estimates realistic for remaining MVP 1.0 features?
  - Entry editing (2-3 hours) - UI + backend + validation + testing
  - Entry titles (1 hour) - Custom titles with auto-generated fallback
  - Dynamic UI enhancement (2-3 hours) - Progressive field display
  - Enhanced validation (1-2 hours) - Comprehensive form validation
  - Mobile optimization (2 hours) - Responsive design improvements
- Total estimated: 8-11 hours for MVP completion
- What's our definition of "MVP 1.0 complete"? Feature completeness vs polish level?

### **Entry Editing User Experience**
**Impact**: High - Core user interaction
- **Edit Interface**: Inline editing, modal popup, or dedicated page?
- **Validation Strategy**: Same strict validation as creation or more permissive for historical entries?
- **Destructive Actions**: Confirmation dialogs for delete? Soft delete vs hard delete?
- **Autosave**: Should editing have autosave to prevent data loss?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important - Should Answer During Implementation

### **HTMX Integration Strategy**
**Impact**: Medium - Development approach consistency
- Which specific interactions use HTMX vs full page reloads?
- Entry form submission, editing interface, daily highlights display?
- Performance strategy: HTMX for enhancements or core functionality?

### **Entry Titles Implementation**
**Impact**: Medium - MVP feature quality
- **Title Length Limits**: Maximum character count for custom titles?
- **Auto-generation Logic**: Date format for default titles ("January 15, 2025 Journal")?
- **Validation Rules**: Character restrictions, special characters allowed?
- **Display Strategy**: How to handle very long titles in lists?

### **Dynamic UI Progressive Display**
**Impact**: Medium - User experience quality
- **Field Show Logic**: Exactly when does next field appear (on focus, on content, on blur)?
- **Performance Considerations**: JavaScript approach vs server-side rendering?
- **Mobile Behavior**: Different logic for touch interfaces?
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader compatibility with dynamic field appearance?

### **Session Management Details**
**Impact**: Medium - Security & UX
- **Session Duration**: How long should sessions last? Remember me functionality?
- **Multi-Device Support**: Concurrent sessions or single session enforcement?
- **Session Invalidation**: Triggers for session expiry (password change, etc.)?

### **Error Handling Philosophy**
**Impact**: Medium - User experience quality
- **User Messaging**: Technical error details vs user-friendly messages?
- **Recovery Actions**: What can users do when operations fail?
- **Graceful Degradation**: Behavior when external services are unavailable?

### **Mobile Experience Priorities**
**Impact**: Medium - User accessibility
- **Critical Mobile Flows**: Which features must work flawlessly on mobile?
- **Performance Targets**: Page load times for mobile networks?
- **Touch Interface**: Swipe gestures, optimal touch target sizing?
