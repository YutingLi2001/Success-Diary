## Core Design Principles

### Human-Centered Design

- **Long-term growth**: Designed to support evolving goals while preserving data continuity

### Privacy & Data Ownership
- **Privacy-focused**: No data mining or advertising - user entries remain private
- **Data ownership**: Users maintain full ownership and export capability of their data
- **Local development**: All development and testing done locally with no external data transmission
- **User control**: Complete control over data retention and deletion

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Quantitative Success Criteria
| Metric | Definition | Success Threshold | Measurement Method |
|--------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Active Users** | Number of distinct accounts that create ≥1 entry | **> 10 users** by 4 weeks post-launch | Database query: `COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)` where `entries.count > 0` |
| **User Stickiness** | Average number of days each active user submits an entry within their first 45 days | **> 30 days** | Daily aggregation of entries per user |
| **System Stability** | Production error rate (uncaught exceptions logged per 1,000 requests) | **< 1%** | Monitoring and logging |
| **Self-Adoption** | Consecutive days the founder uses the app | **≥ 50 days** (covers full validation period) | Internal query on entries table |

### Qualitative Success Indicators
