- Advanced analytics beyond basic charts
- Third-party integrations (initially)

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **Active Users**: > 10 users creating ≥1 entry by 4 weeks post-launch
2. **User Stickiness**: > 30 days average entries per user within first 45 days
3. **System Stability**: < 1% error rate in production
4. **Self-adoption**: ≥ 50 consecutive days of founder usage

### Qualitative Goals
- Users report feeling more positive about their daily progress
- Daily highlight feature provides meaningful emotional support
- Interface feels intuitive and reduces friction for daily entry
- Export functionality gives users confidence in data ownership

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Items
- **Authentication Complexity**: FastAPI-Users integration with mixed async/sync patterns
- **Database Migration**: SQLite to PostgreSQL transition for production
- **Timeline Pressure**: 10-week deadline with vacation break

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Testing**: Complete authentication flow testing before vacation
- **Incremental Deployment**: Test AWS deployment with staging environment
- **MVP Focus**: Defer "Should Have" features if timeline pressure increases
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive setup guides for continuity

## Post-Launch Planning
