# Git Workflow Strategy - Success Diary

## âœ… Status: Branch Structure Complete (July 15, 2025)

**All branches created and ready for development:**
- Core branches: `main`, `develop` 
- MVP 1.0 features: 6 feature branches ready
- Infrastructure: `feature/aws-deployment` ready
- **Next step**: Begin development with `git checkout feature/entry-editing`

## Overview
This document defines the version control strategy aligned with our development roadmap phases. The workflow balances development speed with code stability, supporting both rapid AI-assisted development and production deployment requirements.

## Branch Strategy

### Core Branches

#### `main` (Production-Ready)
- **Purpose**: Stable, production-ready code only
- **Protection**: Protected branch with required reviews
- **Deploy Target**: Production AWS environment (post-August 17, 2025)
- **Merge Source**: Only from release branches via Pull Requests
- **Naming**: `main` (GitHub default)

#### `develop` (Integration Branch)
- **Purpose**: Integration branch for completed release phases
- **Stability**: Should always be functional but may have minor bugs
- **Deploy Target**: Development/staging environment
- **Merge Source**: Release branches via Pull Requests
- **Naming**: `develop`

### Release Branches (Major Phases)

#### `release/mvp-1.0-foundation` - Foundational Systems
- **Purpose**: All foundational systems that enable core features
- **Includes**: Error handling, validation, timezone handling, mobile responsive foundation
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational layer)
- **Merge Target**: `develop` when foundation complete

#### `release/mvp-1.0-core` - Core Features
- **Purpose**: Main user-facing functionality for MVP
- **Includes**: Entry management, dynamic UI, history enhancements
- **Dependencies**: Foundation phase must be complete
- **Merge Target**: `develop` when core features complete

#### `release/mvp-1.0-production` - Production Deployment
- **Purpose**: Infrastructure and deployment preparation
- **Includes**: AWS setup, database migration, production configuration
- **Dependencies**: Foundation and core phases complete
- **Merge Target**: `main` for production deployment

### Feature Branches (Multi-Feature Approach)

#### Foundation Phase Feature Branches
- `feature/form-validation` âœ… **COMPLETED** - Enhanced validation, error handling, script organization
- `feature/timezone-handling` - User timezone detection, settings, and display logic
- `feature/mobile-responsive` - Mobile optimization and responsive design foundation

#### Core Phase Feature Branches
- `feature/entry-management` - Entry editing, titles, archive system, draft/autosave
- `feature/dynamic-ui` - Progressive field display, user feedback systems, UX enhancements
- `feature/history-enhancement` - Enhanced history view, sorting, search functionality

#### Production Phase Feature Branches
- `feature/aws-deployment` - Production infrastructure setup, database migration, email service

#### Version 2.0+ Feature Branches (Future)
- `feature/health-tracking` - Complete health modules (diet, exercise, sleep, productivity)
- `feature/advanced-analytics` - Data visualization, insights, export functionality
- `feature/custom-fields` - User-defined fields and advanced customization

### Hotfix Branches
- `hotfix/critical-bug-name` - Critical production fixes
- Merged directly to `main` and back-merged to `develop`

## Workflow Process

### 1. Phase-Based Development Workflow

```bash
# Start new feature within a release phase
git checkout release/mvp-1.0-foundation
git pull origin release/mvp-1.0-foundation
git checkout -b feature/timezone-handling

# Work on feature (may include multiple related components)
# ... implement timezone detection ...
# ... add settings UI ...
# ... update date display logic ...
git add .
git commit -m "implement timezone handling system

- Add browser timezone detection with fallback
- Create user settings for manual timezone override
- Update all date displays to use user timezone
- Add timezone persistence to user model

# Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/timezone-handling
```

### 2. Feature Completion Workflow

```bash
# Create Pull Request to release branch (using GitHub CLI)
gh pr create --base release/mvp-1.0-foundation --title "Complete timezone handling system" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

- **Production Releases**: Thorough testing checklist completion
- **Breaking Changes**: Extra validation and documentation

## Emergency Procedures

### Hotfix Process
```bash
# Critical bug in production
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-login-issue

# Fix the issue
# ... make minimal changes ...
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical login redirect loop

- Fix authentication redirect logic
- Add error handling for edge cases
- Restore proper user flow

ðŸ¤– Generated with Claude Code

# Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-login-issue
git push origin main

# Back-merge to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop

# Clean up
git branch -d hotfix/critical-login-issue
git push origin --delete hotfix/critical-login-issue
```

### Rollback Process
```bash
# If deployment fails, rollback main
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Go back one commit
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
- Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100 MB
- Require signed commits (recommended for production)

### Develop Branch
- Require pull request reviews (can be bypassed for urgent fixes)
- Allow force pushes (for development flexibility)
- Delete head branches automatically after merge

## Tools and Automation

### Recommended GitHub CLI Commands
```bash
# Quick PR creation
gh pr create --title "feat: implement feature name" --body-file pr-template.md

# View PR status
gh pr status

# Merge with squash
gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch

# Create release
gh release create v1.0.0 --title "MVP 1.0 Release" --notes-file release-notes.md
```

### Git Aliases (Optional)
```bash
# Add to ~/.gitconfig
[alias]
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    ci = commit
    st = status
    cp = cherry-pick
    unstage = reset HEAD --
    last = log -1 HEAD
    visual = !gitk
    tree = log --graph --pretty=format:'%h -%d %s (%cr) <%an>' --abbrev-commit
```

git push origin feature/entry-editing

# Create PR when ready
gh pr create --base develop --title "Add entry editing functionality"
```

### Recommended Development Order
Based on roadmap priorities:

1. **`feature/entry-editing`** (Highest Priority)
2. **`feature/history-enhancement`** (Supports editing)
3. **`feature/entry-titles`** (User experience)
4. **`feature/dynamic-ui`** (User experience)
5. **`feature/form-validation`** (Data integrity)
6. **`feature/mobile-responsive`** (Final polish)

## Success Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Target**: Complete MVP 1.0 features within 8-10 hours
- **Measure**: Time from feature branch creation to merge
- **Goal**: Maintain AI-assisted development speed while improving code quality

### Code Quality
- **Target**: Zero critical bugs in production
- **Measure**: Issues reported post-deployment
- **Goal**: Comprehensive testing before release merges

### Process Adoption
- **Target**: 100% feature work done in feature branches
- **Measure**: Commits directly to main (should be 0 after transition)
- **Goal**: Smooth workflow adoption without development speed loss
